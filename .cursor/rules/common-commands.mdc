# Common Nuxt Commands

Common development and build commands are defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json):

*   `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot reloading.
*   `yarn build` or `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `yarn generate` or `npm run generate`: Builds the application and pre-renders routes for static hosting.
*   `yarn preview` or `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

These commands use the Nuxt CLI and should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
