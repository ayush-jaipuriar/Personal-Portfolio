# Styling with Tailwind CSS

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com) for styling.

*   Configuration is managed in [tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js).
*   Global styles or base layer customizations might be found in the `assets/` directory (e.g., `assets/css/tailwind.css`).
*   Utility classes are applied directly in the Vue components within the `components/`, `pages/`, and `layouts/` directories.
