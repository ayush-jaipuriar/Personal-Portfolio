This is a placeholder file for where you should place your headshot image.

For a real implementation, replace this text file with an actual JPG image file named "placeholder-headshot.jpg".

You should use a square image with at least 500x500 pixels resolution for best results.

This image will be used in multiple locations throughout the site, including:
- The home page hero section
- The about page
- The blog post author section
