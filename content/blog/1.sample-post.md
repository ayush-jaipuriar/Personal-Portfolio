# Building a Personal Portfolio with Nuxt 3

In today's competitive job market, having a professional portfolio website is essential for software developers. It's a digital representation of your skills, experiences, and personality that can set you apart from other candidates. In this guide, we'll explore how to build a modern, responsive portfolio website using Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, and following best practices.

## Why Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 is a powerful meta-framework built on top of Vue 3 that provides an amazing developer experience while delivering high-performance applications. Here are some reasons to choose Nuxt 3 for your portfolio:

1. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Create lightning-fast static sites that can be hosted on CDNs for optimal performance.
2. **SEO-friendly** - With automatic metadata management and server-side rendering capabilities, Nuxt helps your site rank better in search engines.
3. **Vue 3 + Composition API** - Leverage the latest Vue features for state management and reusable logic.
4. **File-based routing** - Intuitive page creation without manual route configuration.
5. **Built-in optimizations** - Image optimization, code splitting, and more out of the box.

## Setting Up Your Nuxt 3 Project

To get started, you'll need to set up a new Nuxt 3 project:

```bash
npx nuxi init portfolio-website
cd portfolio-website
npm install
```

This creates a minimal Nuxt 3 application with the essential structure. Then, install Tailwind CSS for styling:

```bash
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

And add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
})
```

## Project Structure

A well-organized project structure makes development easier and more maintainable:

```
├── assets/            # Static assets like images and global CSS
├── components/        # Reusable Vue components
├── content/           # Markdown content for blog posts or projects
├── layouts/           # Page layouts
├── pages/             # Application pages and routes
├── public/            # Publicly accessible files
├── app.vue            # The root Vue component
└── nuxt.config.ts     # Nuxt configuration
```

## Essential Pages for a Developer Portfolio

Every developer portfolio should include these key sections:

### Home Page / Hero Section

The hero section is the first thing visitors see, so it should make a strong impression. Include:

- Your name and professional title
- A brief, compelling introduction
- A professional photo or avatar
- Call-to-action buttons (e.g., "View Projects", "Contact Me")

### About Me

This is where you tell your story and share your background:

- Professional journey and experiences
- Education and certifications
- Personal interests and hobbies (to add a human touch)
- Your values and what drives you as a developer

### Projects

Showcase your best work with:

- Project thumbnails and titles
- Brief descriptions
- Technologies used
- Links to live demos and GitHub repositories
- Detailed case studies for your most significant projects

### Skills

Present your technical skills:

- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Tools and platforms
- Soft skills

### Blog (Optional)

A blog demonstrates your expertise and thought leadership:

- Technical tutorials
- Case studies
- Industry insights
- Career advice

### Contact

Make it easy for potential clients or employers to reach you:

- Contact form
- Email address
- Social media links
- Resume download

## Implementing Dark Mode

Dark mode has become a standard feature in modern websites. Nuxt makes it easy to implement with the Color Mode module:

```bash
npm install -D @nuxtjs/color-mode
```

Add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss', '@nuxtjs/color-mode'],
  colorMode: {
    preference: 'system', // default value of $colorMode.preference
    fallback: 'light',    // fallback value if not system preference found
    classSuffix: '',      // suffix for dark mode classes
  }
})
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

To achieve high Lighthouse scores:

1. **Optimize images** - Use appropriate formats (WebP) and sizes, and implement lazy loading.
2. **Minimize CSS and JavaScript** - Remove unused styles and code.
3. **Implement proper caching** - Set appropriate cache headers.
4. **Use responsive design** - Ensure your site works well on all devices.
5. **Reduce layout shifts** - Prevent content jumps by setting dimensions for dynamic content.

## Deployment Options

When your portfolio is ready, you have several excellent hosting options:

- **Netlify** - Offers easy deployment directly from Git with continuous integration.
- **Vercel** - Created by the Next.js team but works beautifully with Nuxt as well.
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting for static sites directly from your repository.

## Conclusion

Building a professional portfolio with Nuxt 3 not only showcases your projects but also demonstrates your ability to create modern, performant web applications. It's an investment in your career that can open doors to new opportunities.

Remember that your portfolio should evolve as you grow professionally. Keep it updated with your latest projects and continuously improve the user experience and design.

Happy coding!
